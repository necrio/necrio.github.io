Hello. 

This is my second journal. I believe this course has given me what I needed most. A structured course that holds a stick over my head and a carrot in front of my face. 

The carrot is that awesome feeling when you are writing some code in the lab, where is challenging.  And then bam. You try something and it just works. Especially when you are writing code with tests that are case sensitive. I have had so many labs that I was stuck on for a couple days. But I had it correct the whole time. The only thing that was missing was a capital letter or period. 

I am currently running through OO ruby. I like it far more than pro ruby. It seems a lot easier to code with. 

I will be doing a couple projects coming up next week. I feel like I want to really sink my teeth into them. But I also feel like I don’t have enough knowledge to understand what I’d be writing. 

Also. Working with ruby isn’t as quick and simple as something like CSS. Where you could add a margin or border. And almost instantly see something. 

I’m excited to push forward.
