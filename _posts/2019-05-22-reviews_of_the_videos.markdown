This is the next blog. A bit past due, but better late than never! 

The suggested topic this time around is about the review videos. While I definitely support review. As an educator for nearly 10 years, reinforcement is the main way to actually learning something. However, the video reviews are lacking in a lot of key areas that really help review or reinforce what was previously taught.

I think videos have gave me a bit more in regards to learning ruby than reading vague text.  To be honest, I cannot understand the overall way of explaining code that is usually taught. For example, I was looking over some SVG avatar tgat responded to input into an email / password field. It was cute, elegant, and fantastic. However, the developer of it explained it as to what he was thinking when he made it and thus is was made. 

This is often done in the review videos as well. I simply learn differently than other programmers. When  I am told how their thought process went or the video trying to streer me into a certain thought process, I often draw a blank. 

Perhaps that is another reason why so many people give up on coding and why I gave up on coding so many times before coming to Flatiron. We need a more short detailed approach. The tutorials I do on the side to reinforce my skills are a lot more engaging and I remember more.
